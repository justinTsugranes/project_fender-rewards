          <h1>Rewards Program Requirements:</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Integration:</strong>
              <p>
                The rewards program should be integrated with both Fender
                Digital's e-commerce store and select dealer partners, allowing
                customers to earn and redeem rewards both online and in-store.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Points Accumulation:</strong>
              <p>
                Customers should be able to earn points not only through
                purchases but also by completing specific achievements, such as
                completing courses on Fender Play or using Fender Tune to tune
                their guitars.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Points Expiry:</strong>
              <p>
                The earned rewards points should have an expiration period,
                typically set to one year. After that period, the points should
                expire and no longer be redeemable.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Partial Redemption:</strong>
              <p>
                Customers should have the flexibility to choose how many points
                they want to redeem at a given time. They should not be required
                to redeem all their accumulated points in a single transaction.
              </p>

              <p>
                The rewards program drives desired customer behaviors, such as
                completing courses on Fender Play or regularly using Fender
                Tune. It promotes skill development, product usage, and customer
                retention.

              <strong>Personalized Benefits:</strong>
              <p>
                Customers can choose how they want to utilize their earned
                rewards points. They can redeem them for discounts on future
                purchases, free merchandise, or other exclusive offers tailored
                to their preferences, enhancing their overall shopping
                experience.

                in-store, Fender aims to provide a seamless and consistent
                experience for customers across various touchpoints. This
                enhances the overall customer experience and strengthens the
                relationship between the brand and its customers.
              </p>

              <strong>Increased Sales and Revenue:</strong>
              <p>
                The rewards program serves as an additional incentive for
                customers to make purchases and engage with Fender's products
                and services. This can lead to increased sales and revenue for
                the company.
              </p>

            <li>
              <strong>Data Collection and Insights:</strong>
              <p>
                The rewards program enables the collection of valuable customer
                data, including purchase behavior, preferences, and engagement
                patterns. This data can be analyzed to gain insights into
                customer preferences and behavior, which can inform future
                marketing strategies and product development initiatives.

          <h1>Algorithm for Redemption of Fender Rewards Points:</h1>
          <p>
            Considering points expiry after a year and the ability for partial
            redemption, here is a proposed algorithm that takes into account
            edge cases and security concerns:
          </p>

          <h2>Points Expiry:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              At regular intervals (e.g., daily), the algorithm checks the
              points balance for each user and identifies any points that have
              expired based on the one-year validity period.
            </li>
            <li>
              Expired points are automatically removed from the user's points
              balance.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Partial Redemption:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When a user initiates a redemption, they can specify the number of
              points they want to redeem.
            </li>
            <li>
              The algorithm verifies that the requested redemption amount is
              within the available points balance for the user.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the requested redemption amount is valid, the algorithm
              processes the redemption and deducts the redeemed points from the
              user's balance.
            </li>
            <li>
              The remaining points remain intact and can be used for future
              redemptions.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Edge Cases:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Expired but Unredeemed Points: A user tries to redeem points that
              were earned more than a year ago and are now expired but were not
              previously redeemed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Redeemed Points: A user tries to redeem points that have already
              been redeemed but are not yet expired.
            </li>
            <li>
              Insufficient Points: A user tries to redeem more points than they
              have in their account.
            </li>
            <li>
              Negative Points: A user somehow ends up with a negative points
              balance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Expiring Points: The server and database are hosted in differing
              time zones causing sync issues when expiring points.
            </li>
            <li>
              Concurrent Transactions: Multiple requests trying to redeem points
              for the same user at the same time (this could potentially lead to
              race conditions where more points are redeemed than the user
              actually has).
            </li>
            <li>
              Data Consistency: The frontend and backend data are out of sync,
              perhaps due to a failure in updating one or the other.
            </li>
            <li>
              Inactive User Accounts: A user who hasn't used their account for a
              long time may try to redeem points; you might want to consider if
              points expire due to inactivity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Database Failures: The database is down or otherwise not
              responding, causing failures in updating the points balance.
            </li>
            <li>
              User Identification: The system fails to correctly identify the
              user, or two users have the same identification information (like
              name or email).
            </li>
            <li>
              Redeeming Points During Acquisition: A user tries to redeem points
              at the exact same time as they are earning new points.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Security Concerns:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              User Authentication: Before allowing any redemption, the algorithm
              verifies the user's authentication to ensure the request is coming
              from a valid and authorized user.
            </li>
            <li>
              Secure Communication: All interactions between the frontend,
              backend, and any involved systems should be encrypted using secure
              protocols (e.g., HTTPS) to protect sensitive user data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Input Validation: The algorithm includes robust input validation
              to prevent malicious input and protect against security
              vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS)
              attacks.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Performance Considerations:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The algorithm should be designed for efficient performance,
              considering the potential scale of the rewards program and the
              need to handle multiple concurrent redemption requests.
            </li>
            <li>
              Caching Mechanisms: Employing caching techniques to store and
              retrieve points balances can help optimize performance and reduce
              the load on the backend systems.
            </li>
            <li>
              Database Indexing: Proper indexing of relevant database tables can
              improve query performance when retrieving and updating points
              balances.
            </li>

        <h3>Rewards Program Requirements:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Integration:</strong>
            <p>
              The rewards program should be integrated with both Fender
              Digital's e-commerce store and select dealer partners, allowing
              customers to earn and redeem rewards both online and in-store.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Points Accumulation:</strong>
            <p>
              Customers should be able to earn points not only through
              purchases but also by completing specific achievements, such as
              completing courses on Fender Play or using Fender Tune to tune
              their guitars.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Points Expiry:</strong>
            <p>
              The earned rewards points should have an expiration period,
              typically set to one year. After that period, the points should
              expire and no longer be redeemable.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Partial Redemption:</strong>
            <p>
              Customers should have the flexibility to choose how many points
              they want to redeem at a given time. They should not be required
              to redeem all their accumulated points in a single transaction.
            </p>

        <h3>Algorithm for Redemption of Fender Rewards Points:</h3>
        <p>
          Considering points expiry after a year and the ability for partial
          redemption, here is a proposed algorithm that takes into account
          edge cases and security concerns:
        </p>

        <h4>Points Expiry:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            At regular intervals (e.g., daily), the algorithm checks the
            points balance for each user and identifies any points that have
            expired based on the one-year validity period.
          </li>
          <li>
            Expired points are automatically removed from the user's points
            balance.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Partial Redemption:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When a user initiates a redemption, they can specify the number of
            points they want to redeem.
          </li>
          <li>
            The algorithm verifies that the requested redemption amount is
            within the available points balance for the user.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the requested redemption amount is valid, the algorithm
            processes the redemption and deducts the redeemed points from the
            user's balance.
          </li>
          <li>
            The remaining points remain intact and can be used for future
            redemptions.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Edge Cases:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Expired but Unredeemed Points: A user tries to redeem points that
            were earned more than a year ago and are now expired but were not
            previously redeemed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Redeemed Points: A user tries to redeem points that have already
            been redeemed but are not yet expired.
          </li>
          <li>
            Insufficient Points: A user tries to redeem more points than they
            have in their account.
          </li>
          <li>
            Negative Points: A user somehow ends up with a negative points
            balance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Expiring Points: The server and database are hosted in differing
            time zones causing sync issues when expiring points.
          </li>
          <li>
            Concurrent Transactions: Multiple requests trying to redeem points
            for the same user at the same time (this could potentially lead to
            race conditions where more points are redeemed than the user
            actually has).
          </li>
          <li>
            Data Consistency: The frontend and backend data are out of sync,
            perhaps due to a failure in updating one or the other.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inactive User Accounts: A user who hasn't used their account for a
            long time may try to redeem points; you might want to consider if
            points expire due to inactivity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Database Failures: The database is down or otherwise not
            responding, causing failures in updating the points balance.
          </li>
          <li>
            User Identification: The system fails to correctly identify the
            user, or two users have the same identification information (like
            name or email).
          </li>
          <li>
            Redeeming Points During Acquisition: A user tries to redeem points
            at the exact same time as they are earning new points.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Security Concerns:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            User Authentication: Before allowing any redemption, the algorithm
            verifies the user's authentication to ensure the request is coming
            from a valid and authorized user.
          </li>
          <li>
            Secure Communication: All interactions between the frontend,
            backend, and any involved systems should be encrypted using secure
            protocols (e.g., HTTPS) to protect sensitive user data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Input Validation: The algorithm includes robust input validation
            to prevent malicious input and protect against security
            vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS)
            attacks.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Performance Considerations:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The algorithm should be designed for efficient performance,
            considering the potential scale of the rewards program and the
            need to handle multiple concurrent redemption requests.
          </li>

        <h4>Data Structure Example</h4>
        <img src="img/json.webp" alt="a json representation of the schema" />
        
        <h4>Explanation of the Data Structure</h4>
        <p><strong>redemptionSchema:</strong> This schema represents the redemption transactions made by a user.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>redemption_id:</strong> The unique identifier for the redemption.</li>
          <li><strong>redeemed_points:</strong> The number of points redeemed in the transaction.</li>
          <li><strong>redemption_date:</strong> The date when the redemption was made.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>pointsSchema:</strong> This schema represents the assignment and redemption of points to/from a user.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>transaction_id:</strong> The unique identifier for the transaction.</li>
          <li><strong>original_points:</strong> The original amount of points assigned in this transaction.</li>
          <li><strong>remaining_points:</strong> The remaining points after any possible redemptions.</li>
          <li><strong>assignment_date:</strong> The date when the points were assigned.</li>
          <li><strong>expiry_date:</strong> The date when the points are set to expire.</li>
          <li><strong>source_platform:</strong> The platform from which the points originated.</li>
          <li><strong>redemptions:</strong> An array of redemption records (based on redemptionSchema), capturing the details of any points redeemed.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>rewardPointSchema:</strong> This schema represents a user's reward points records.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>points:</strong> An array of points records, each record based on pointsSchema, holding details about point assignments and redemptions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>userSchema:</strong> This is the main schema representing a user in the application.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>id:</strong> The unique identifier for a user.</li>
          <li><strong>name:</strong> The name of the user.</li>
          <li><strong>email:</strong> The email of the user. It is unique for every user.</li>
          <li><strong>points_balance:</strong> The total balance of the user's reward points. This defaults to 0 and is not required upon creation.</li>
          <li><strong>reward_points:</strong> An instance of rewardPointSchema, representing the user's reward points history.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Benefits of the Proposed Data Structure</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Normalization:</strong> The structure of the schema is highly normalized. This means that the data is divided into distinct schemas (like redemptionSchema, pointsSchema, etc.), each responsible for a specific aspect of the data. This makes the data structure more understandable and easy to maintain.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scalability:</strong> Each of the schemas represents a specific aspect of the user's data, making it easier to extend and modify the data structure as the application grows. For example, if there are new properties or new kinds of transactions to track in the future, it's straightforward to extend the respective schema.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Avoidance of Data Redundancy:</strong> The use of subdocuments (like the points array within the rewardPointSchema) reduces data redundancy and promotes data integrity. Any change to a particular point or redemption does not need to be reflected in multiple places; it only needs to be updated within its specific document.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Traceability:</strong> The use of the pointsSchema and redemptionSchema allows us to keep track of every points transaction that a user makes, including points assignment, redemption, remaining points, and expiration. This ensures full traceability of the points lifecycle, which is critical for a reward points system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Efficiency:</strong> Querying the user data will also bring all the related points and redemption data, minimizing the need for additional database queries. This can significantly improve the efficiency of data retrieval in the application.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>User Experience:</strong> This data structure allows for rich, user-specific insights, such as individual points balances, transaction histories, and redemptions. It allows the application to provide a personalized user experience, which is crucial in today's user-centric digital products.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Integrity:</strong> With the use of <code>required: true</code> in several fields in the schemas, this structure ensures essential data is always present for each user, points transaction, and redemption, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Potential Complexties and Hurdles</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Nested Data Complexity:</strong> The deeply nested structure of the data (the redemptionSchema nested within the pointsSchema, which is nested within the rewardPointSchema, which is nested within the userSchema) might make it more complex to query, especially when trying to extract or update specific redemption or points data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Performance:</strong> While subdocuments can be efficient for read operations, they may cause performance issues when you have complex update operations, or if the number of subdocuments grows significantly. Each document in MongoDB has a size limit (currently 16MB as of MongoDB 4.0), which includes subdocuments. If there are a lot of transactions and redemptions for a user, this could potentially become a problem.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Aggregation:</strong> If there's a need for system-wide analytics (for example, calculating the total points redeemed across all users), it might be more challenging and resource-intensive as the data is nested within each individual user's document.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Concurrency Issues:</strong> MongoDB allows atomic operations at the document level. If multiple processes are trying to update different parts of a user's points or redemptions, there could potentially be concurrency issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Duplication:</strong> While the proposed schema helps to avoid data redundancy, there could still be some level of data duplication. For example, the points_balance in the userSchema needs to be kept in sync with the sum of remaining_points in all the points transactions. This can be challenging to maintain over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Schema Rigidity:</strong> Despite MongoDB being a NoSQL database which allows for flexible schema design, this proposed data structure enforces a rigid schema using mongoose. If business requirements change frequently, updating the rigid schema could be a hurdle.
